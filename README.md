# ML Project : Employee Salary Prediction
I have created a machine learning project using various machine learning algorithms, hyper tuning parameters to predict the correct salary of an employee based on the factor like their experience, qualification, and location 
After performing EDA, I concluded that salary is directly related to an employer's experiences and location.
The salary column is continuous data,  so we are using regression algorithms like  Linear Regression,  Random  Forest Regressor, and  KNeighbors Regressor  to predict the salary of an employee
After analyzing various models, we would like to improve the accuracy of our model so we have performed hyper-tuning parameters and GridSearchCV to find the best parameter and this leads to improve the accuracy.
